1. **Photos must be appropriate:** Users must not use any inappropriate, offensive, or misleading images. All photos must be relevant to the meal and suitable for all ages. We reserve the right to remove any content that we deem inappropriate.

2. **Use high-quality photos:** To ensure the best user experience, we require that all photos be of high quality. Blurry, poorly lit, or low-resolution images will not be accepted.

3. **No inappropriate or inaccurate information:** Users must provide accurate and truthful information about the meal they are submitting. Information that is inaccurate, misleading, or contains false claims is not allowed. Any content that violates this rule will be removed.

4. **Depth of meal:** We encourage users to provide detailed information about the meal they are submitting, including ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional information. Meals that lack sufficient information will not be accepted.

5. **Inappropriate name:** Users must not use inappropriate or offensive names for their meals. Any content that violates this rule will be removed.

6. **No spelling or grammar errors:** Users are expected to proofread and ensure that their content is free from spelling or grammar errors. Any content that violates this rule will not be accepted.

We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these rules, and may also take action against repeat offenders, including revoking their access to the Nutribird app.
